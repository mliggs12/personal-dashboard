## Process steps

1. Mind dump - Go to next step when finished or after 1 min.
2. Show list and select the thing that is bothering me most in the moment. Create a new 'Specific negative' sheet.
3. "Complain to the sheet"
   - Get everything off your mind and let out all your feelings regarding the subject.
   - Be able to access the list at any time to add anything else that pops into mind that is even slightly related.
4. Once finished, close the sheet and completely forget about what was written.
   - The `Sheet` shadcn component immediately comes to mind for this.
5. Focus on where in the body you are feeling the emotional pain. Perform EFT process on this feeling.
6. Once neutral, open the sheet and read through each statement, tapping out any that still feel bad.
   - Consider using a checkbox that applies a strikethrough.
7. Move on to as many more items on the original list and repeat the process.
8. When satisfied end the process and move on to "Positive Aspects" then "Rampage of Appreciation".
